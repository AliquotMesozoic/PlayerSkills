# For players
This mod allows players to level up their character over time by completing certain tasks, gaining achievements, crafting items, and in general just playing the game. 

As you progress, PlayerSkills will expose three skill trees which you can chose to level depending on your style of play. You can chose to reset your skill points at any given time simply by opening up the mod menu (default key: h) and clicking "reset skill tree" under the "skills" tab.

## First steps
All methods for leveling your character in this mod are categorized under two labels. passive leveling techniques are controlled via the environment — for example, the passing of time, the weather, and current biome all have an effect on your player's abilities. Non-passive leveling techniques are controlled by the player — this includes crafting items, mining ores, and exploring new biomes or dimensions. It is important to remember that only non-passive leveling techniques will allow you to upgrade skills in your chosen skill-tree — passive leveling will improve your player, but typically this will happen automatically as you play, and requires no thought on your part. Non-passive leveling techniques usually provide far more powerful effects and customizability.

In order to take your first steps towards non-passive leveling, you're going to want to first open up the SP menu and click 'begin your adventure'. This unlocks your first achievement, and with it you gain the ability to chose your character's class.

### On classes and traits
PlayerSkills attempts to encourage you to play with a variety of Minecraft mechanics in order to level all areas of your player. However, most people tend to have certain styles of play which lend themselves to different traits. Classes allow you to level your character in a more focused manner, meaning that your progression in these areas is much more rapid. Classes do *not* prevent you from leveling in other areas.

By default there are three classes which you can chose from. The warrior class specializes in attacking hostiles, farming mobs, and different manners of movement. The earthen class specializes in mining and generating ores, farming crops, and upgrading tools to have different capabilities. The automaton class specializes in the automation of different processes, such as grinding ores, harvesting and planting food, and transfering items around the world.

In order to level your character, you must take part in the activities which your class specifies. For example, one way to level the warrior class is to attack mobs. After attacking a certain number of mobs, you will see a popup on the upper-right which notifies you of XP gain. XP is used in order to select character traits.

Traits are the most powerful part of this mod. They give your player abilities which far exceed the capabilities of vanilla mechanics, such as spawning mobs with specialized traits, creating tools that work on their own, and making machines that can do your crafting for you.

Although each class has its own distinct advantages, there are some traits which are shared between the classes, allowing the player to level them at the same rate regardless of class. You can find a list of these shared traits on the [shared traits](shared traits) page.
